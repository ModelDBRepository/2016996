find_epsp_amplitudes() : Finds the appropriate conductances for AMPAR synapses depending on their location such that the unitary epsp amplitude at the soma is the same irrespective of the location of the synapse.

After finding the synaptic conductances stated above, comment find_epsp_amplitudes() and uncomment the calc_epsp_amplitudes() function to calculate the actual epsp ampliudes at the soma.
