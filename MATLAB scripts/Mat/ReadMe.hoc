1) First run soma_centers.m to compute the location (x,y,z) of the soma of the 440 neurons.

    In the morphology used, y co-ordinate is used for depth.

2) Run n123_440.m to rotate and translate the entire morphology to the centers computed in step 1.

3) Run Dist_cal.m to compute the distance of each line segment of each neuron from the different electrode locations (ptcoord).

4) Use the computed distances to weight the line currents and compute LFP using phi_cal_line.m
